# Natural Language Programming: N-Grams

This project was to develop a simple n-gram algorithm. It reads in a corpus of text to predict what the next word should be given an input.

- The [Blogs](Blogs/) folder contains the files with the text to train on. They are formatted as HTML in .xml files. Only the text within the <post> tags are used for training.
- The [ngram_functions.py]() file contains the functions to perform the algorithm
- The [main.ipynb]() file shows the code being run in a Jupyter Notebook and the results on a few small sample texts.
